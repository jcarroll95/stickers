# Stickerboards API

>Hi! 

>This project is the API for a Node.js / Express system using MongoDB.

>This backend contains endpoints for creating doses, collections of doses, comments, ratings, and statistics. It implements basic user account creation and administration, authentication and security.

>The backend v1.0 is completed, tested, documented, and deployed. Front end in progress.
