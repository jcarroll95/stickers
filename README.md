Hi! 

This learning project is the backend and middleware for a Node.js / Express system using MongoDB. 

The website it implements is a shot and side effect tracker for GLP-1 medicine users, where weekly injections and associated information can be recorded and recalled.

Once the basic functionality is created and deployed I'll add the frontend.
