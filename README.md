Hi! 

This learning project is the backend for a Node.js / Express system using MongoDB. 

The website it implements is a shot and side effect tracker for GLP-1 medicine users, where weekly injections and associated information can be recorded and recalled.

The backend is nearly complete. Once we have a basic front-end for users to access it we'll deploy and update here.
